# GARP Strategy Project

## Overview
This project implements the Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP) strategy, blending growth and value investing principles. It targets companies with consistent growth, fair valuation, and robust financial health. The strategy employs a meticulous methodology, combining Growth and Quality & Value (QV) metrics to form the GARP universe, investing equally across selected assets.

## Methodology
- **Growth Metrics**: Utilizes three-year EPS and SPS growth rates.
- **Valuation Metrics**: Applies financial ratios like ROE and Earnings-to-Price.
- **Financial Health**: Focuses on companies with strong profitability and manageable leverage.
- **Strategy Execution**: Constructs Growth and QV universes, selecting their intersection for the GARP universe with equal weighting across assets.

## Data and Analysis
- Detailed analysis of S&P500 sectors and industries based on the GARP indices methodology.
- Transaction costs are set at 10 basis points, with accounting data lagged by four months to prevent lookahead bias.
- The strategy spans from November 2003 to November 2023, assessing performance across various metrics and robustness checks.
